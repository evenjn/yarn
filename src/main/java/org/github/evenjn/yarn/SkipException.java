/**
 * {@link org.github.evenjn.yarn.SkipMap SkipMap} and
 * {@link org.github.evenjn.yarn.SkipFold SkipFold} use {@code SkipException} to
 * signal that no output is associated to the given input.
 * 
 * <h2>âš  Warning</h2>
 * <p>
 * Code that relies on exceptions to implement anything other than aborting and
 * logging is error-prone. This is the case even with so-called <em>checked
 * exceptions</em>. Specifically, adding an invocation that throws a checked
 * exception into a block that already deals with that exception gives no
 * warning to the developer, and the fact that the invocation throws a checked
 * exception may go unnoticed. If so, this introduces a hidden control flow path
 * which may have unintended consequences.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Code that deals with exceptions, either by floating them or by catching them,
 * always requires a careful inspection of all signatures of invoked methods to
 * make sure no hidden control flow paths exist. For this reason, exceptions are
 * best avoided if possible.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In particular, we recommend against using {@code SkipException} for purposes
 * other than its intended one. This means we recommend not to declare functions
 * that throw {@code SkipException} except functions that implement interface
 * methods.
 * </p>
